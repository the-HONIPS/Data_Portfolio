Starting out with the initial stage of HNG 11 internship program, I analysed a retail vehicle sales dataset obtained from Kaggle. 
This analysis aims to provide a preliminary review of the dataset to identify key patterns, trends, and provide insights for potential further analysis.

Data Overview
The dataset comprises 2,823 entries and includes a variety of data fields such as order number, quantity ordered, price, order line number, sales, order date, status etc. As obtained from Kaggle, the dataset contains information about a company involved in the retail sale of various vehicles, including classic cars, motorcycles, planes, ships, trains, trucks and buses, and vintage cars which spans between the year 2003 to 2005.
Data Integrity and Anomalies: Review shows that there are no duplicate data set.

Product Analysis
The year 2004 has the highest number of vehicles sold, with a total of 1,345 units.
Among the vehicle categories, classic cars are the most shipped, with a total of 425 units in 2004.
There is a noticeable increase in the number of vehicles sold from 2003 to 2004, indicating a significant rise in demand or sales volume during that period. However,the year 2005 shows strike decline in volume of sales.
